The solution addresses the specificity issue by making the selectors more precise and consistent:

```css
/*Solution*/
#myDiv.container {
  color: purple !important; /* Forcing purple if necessary */
}

#myDiv.container div {
  color: orange; /*Ensuring no conflict*/
}

div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#myDiv {
  color: green;
}
```
This approach addresses the cascade conflicts by ensuring that the selectors are unambiguous. The use of `!important` is included to emphasize the necessity of making the selectors precise and efficient in conflict resolution; however, it should be used sparingly.
